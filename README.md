# Hi, I'm Jorge Castillo! üëã

I am passionate about technology and sports (Ultimate Frisbee and Cycling), I love learning and testing knowledge with projects. Right now I am finishing Henry's bootcamp; last year I decided to focus my career on software development and I love what I have learned and the proyection of that knowledge into comercial proyects.

## Things you might find interesting
üë©‚Äçüíª I'm currently working on my portfolio, 3 aditional projects that I did in the bootcamp and deserve to be here. 

üß† I'm currently learning Tailwind and Typescript.

üí¨ Ask me about Javascript, React, Redux, HTML5, CCS, Sass, NodeJs, PostgreSQL, Auth0, Sequelize

üì´ How to reach me

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact, I have made 3 solo bicycle trips through Colombia, in the first two I took a tent, sleeping bag, food and many tools, it was not until I finished the second trip and having camped only once that I decided to travel without a tent and other accessories, no matter how many kilometers I have traveled, my greatest achievement was NOT PACKING what I probably was not going to use.

## My Goals

Enjoy my life while grow as a person, I want to help many children through sports, tech, education and culture. that is the fuel that motivates me to code.
Someday I will upload a photo of that personal project [ Reserved Space ]

As a developer I want to solidify my skills and gain experience in the field to support big projects (also in the OpenSource ones), is hard to set a route but not a step, so by now I am learning 2 new thecnologies simultaneously and adding them to my stack.

## Proyects ‚ö°Ô∏è Here is the real fun ‚ö°Ô∏è

## 2doApp - The upgrade version of the task management

I work on the task management as the improved version of the usual developers project, adding few features like emailing, formating in alert panels, manage a set of users, using a nonSql database, and deploy with google cloud, so proud of the result.

You can experience the page in this url:

## Videogames App - Single Page Application

It is an application that has a video game database that receives some (first 100 from more than 700 thousand videogames listed in Rawg) data both from an API and from its own database (created using PostgreSQL and managed through Sequelize).

The page has a Landing Page with an animation that gives time for the information to load by the API response, once inside you can sort by rating or name, in addition to filtering by category, origin (Database / API) .
Likewise, you can search for a specific name or even go through a certain page to better organize the number of video games displayed. 

Video games can also be created, this through a controlled form that informs the user about the creation requirements and in the same way prevents creation requests from being made with incorrect or empty data, which will be stored in its own database, to which the same filters and sorts will also be applied to them.
