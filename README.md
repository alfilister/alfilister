# Hi, I'm Jorge Castillo! 👋

I am passionate about technology and sports (Ultimate Frisbee and Cycling), I love learning and testing knowledge with projects. Right now I am finishing Henry's bootcamp; last year I decided to focus my career on software development and I love what I have learned and the proyection of that knowledge into comercial proyects.




## Other Common Github Profile Sections
👩‍💻 I'm currently working on my portfolio, 3 aditional projects that I did in the bootcamp and deserve to be here. 

🧠 I'm currently learning Tailwind and Typescript.

⚡️ Fun fact, I have made 3 solo bicycle trips through Colombia, in the first two I took a tent, sleeping bag, food and many tools, it was not until I finished the second trip and having camped only once that I decided to travel without a tent and other accessories, no matter how many kilometers I have traveled, my greatest achievement was NOT PACKING what I probably was not going to use.


## My Goals

Enjoy my life while grow as a person, I want to help many children through sports, education and culture. that is the fuel that motivates me to code.
Someday I will upload a photo of that personal project [ Reserved Space ]

As a developer I want to solidify my skills and gain experience in the field to support big projects (also in the OpenSource ones), is hard to set a route but not a step, so by now I am learning 2 new thecnologies simultaneously and adding them to my stack.
