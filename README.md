# Hi, I'm Jorge Castillo! üëã

I am passionate about technology and sports (Ultimate Frisbee and Cycling), I love learning and testing knowledge with projects. Right now I am finishing Henry's bootcamp; last year I decided to focus my career on software development and I love what I have learned and the proyection of that knowledge into comercial proyects.

## Things you might find interesting
üë©‚Äçüíª I'm currently working on my portfolio, 3 aditional projects that I did in the bootcamp and deserve to be here. 

üß† I'm currently learning Tailwind and Typescript.

üí¨ Ask me about Javascript, React, Redux, HTML5, CCS, Sass, NodeJs, PostgreSQL, Auth0, Sequelize

üì´ How to reach me

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact, I have made 3 solo bicycle trips through Colombia, in the first two I took a tent, sleeping bag, food and many tools, it was not until I finished the second trip and having camped only once that I decided to travel without a tent and other accessories, no matter how many kilometers I have traveled, my greatest achievement was NOT PACKING what I probably was not going to use.

## My Goals

Enjoy my life while grow as a person, I want to help many children through sports, education and culture. that is the fuel that motivates me to code.
Someday I will upload a photo of that personal project [ Reserved Space ]

As a developer I want to solidify my skills and gain experience in the field to support big projects (also in the OpenSource ones), is hard to set a route but not a step, so by now I am learning 2 new thecnologies simultaneously and adding them to my stack.

## Proyects ‚ö°Ô∏è Here is the real fun ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Ecomercell - Tech products ecommerce

Together with a start up of 5 people, we developed an electronic products ecommerce, with common elements within the shopping experience: cart, integrated payment method (Stripe), registration method (Auth0), email sending to inform the user , administrator panel, user panel, order control, stock control, reviews, among other features that we consider necessary.

Here is the home, where you can see the promotional banner and the general widescreen to interact with the web.

When you click on the category bar (located below the navBar) you can see the products related and also use the filter/sort bar.

By clicking on details button (located on each product card) you can see the detail page; here is the complete description and reviews posted by other users. An important feature here is that you can not set a review of a product until buy and be logged.

Once you add products to the shopping cart (by clicking on the cart icon on cards or in the detail page) the cartPage is ready to be shown with the amounts per product, before taxes, and total amount to pay.

Here you have to fill the shipping info and loggin to proceed, other way the proceed button gonna be disabled.

As a tesst the payment method is by Credit Card.

Favorites page, in case you want to track products out of stock or have them easy to find.

Once you place an orden (by a succesfull payment) going through the image next to "logout" button in the navBar you can access to your order history, and see the current state setted by the admin.

And finally the admin panel, where you can control stock, categories, orders, users and products.

Here you set the featured products (easy to recognize in the user experience with a diferent card color and Star on the right). The featured product has a limit of 5 items, to avoid the admin forget to remove the olddest and keeping a real focus.

## Videogames App - Single Page Application

It is an application that has a video game database that receives some (first 100 from more than 700 thousand videogames listed in Rawg) data both from an API and from its own database (created using PostgreSQL and managed through Sequelize).

The page has a Landing Page with an animation that gives time for the information to load by the API response, once inside you can sort by rating or name, in addition to filtering by category, origin (Database / API) .
Likewise, you can search for a specific name or even go through a certain page to better organize the number of video games displayed. 

Video games can also be created, this through a controlled form that informs the user about the creation requirements and in the same way prevents creation requests from being made with incorrect or empty data, which will be stored in its own database, to which the same filters and sorts will also be applied to them.
